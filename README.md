# CGR3-tobacco-2024

## Overview

This repository includes data sets and R scripts that were used to perform
analysis and produce figures for the manuscript titled "Greater mesophyll
conductance and leaf photosynthesis in the field through modified cell wall
porosity and thickness via AtCGR3 expression in tobacco", published in
_Plant Biotechnology Journal_
(DOI: [10.1111/pbi.14364](https://doi.org/10.1111/pbi.14364)).

## Scripts

The `CO2 conductances and effective porosity`, `Field gas exchange`, and
`Greenhouse gas exchange and TDL` directories contain R scripts that were used
for the analysis. These scripts have been tested using the following
installation:

- Windows:
  - R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31 ucrt)
  - Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32
  - Windows 10 Enterprise version 10.0.19045 Build 19045

Additional instructions for running the scripts can be found in the `README.md`
files in those directories.
