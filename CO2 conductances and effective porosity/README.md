# CO2 conductances and effective porosity

## Overview

This directory contains data and analysis scripts used to calculate CO2
conductances and effective porosity. Values from the output file
`CGR3 greenhouse CO2 conductances and effective porosity.csv` were used to
create Figures 1e and 1f. For more details about these calculations, see
Methods S2 in the Supplemenal Information.

## Files

- `leaf_properties.csv`: A table of key input values needed to calculate CO2
  conductances and effective porosity.

- `effective_porosity.R`: An R script that calculates CO2 conductances and
  effective porosity from the contents of `leaf_properties.csv`.

- `CGR3 greenhouse CO2 conductances and effective porosity.csv`: A table of CO2
  conductances and effective porosities that was originally produced by running
  the `effective_porosity.R` script.

## Running the script

1. Set the working directory of an R session to this directory.

2. Type the following to run the script:

   ```r
   source('effective_porosity.R')
   ```

3. The script will produce an output file called `effective_porosity.csv` that
   will be created in this directory. It should be identical to
   `CGR3 greenhouse CO2 conductances and effective porosity.csv`, other than
   small changes in formatting and significant digits introduced by Microsoft
   Excel.

Note: The `effective_porosity.R` script only uses commands from base R, so no
packages are required to use it.

## Data dictionary

### Inputs
